## üåç Adding Language Support

To add support for a new language:

1. **Check spaCy models** - Visit https://spacy.io/models
2. **Test the model** - Ensure it has good NER support
3. **Update the code**:
   ```python
   # In geoNamesFromPdf.py, add to LANGUAGE_MODELS dict:
   LANGUAGE_MODELS = {
       # ...existing languages...
       'xx': 'xx_core_news_lg',  # Your language
   }
   ```
4. **Test thoroughly** - Use sample documents
5. **Update README** - Add language to the supported languages table
6. **Submit PR** - Include test results

## üîß Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   # Click 'Fork' on GitHub, then:
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/geoNamesFromPdf.git
   cd geoNamesFromPdf
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python3.12 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
   # or: venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install PyMuPDF spacy langdetect
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
   python -m spacy download it_core_news_lg
   ```

4. **Create a branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## üìù Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guidelines
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use docstrings for functions

Example:
```python
def extract_toponyms(text, nlp_model):
    """Extract place names using spaCy NER.
    
    Args:
        text (str): The text to analyze
        nlp_model: Loaded spaCy language model
        
    Returns:
        list: Sorted list of unique toponyms
    """
    # Implementation...
```

## üß™ Testing

Before submitting:

1. **Test basic functionality**
   ```bash
   python geoNamesFromPdf.py test_document.pdf
   ```

2. **Test with multiple languages**
   ```bash
   python geoNamesFromPdf.py -l it italian_doc.pdf
   python geoNamesFromPdf.py -l en english_doc.pdf
   ```

3. **Test edge cases**
   - Empty PDFs
   - PDFs with no text
   - Multi-language documents
   - Very large PDFs

4. **Check for errors**
   ```bash
   python geoNamesFromPdf.py --list-languages
   python geoNamesFromPdf.py --install-language xx
   ```
